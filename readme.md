## **Resources**
Code Editor: Visual Studio Code and Kaggle.  
Python Version: Python 3.11 inside Visual Studio Code and 3.7 inside Kaggle.  
Python Packages: requests, pandas, os, numpy, math, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib, sklearn, xgboost.

## **Steps**

### **Summary**
1. **Data Collection**: Scrape data from the official CrossFit Games website.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Filter relevant columns and handle missing values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze variables statistically to gain insights.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new columns with relevant data to enhance the model.
5. **Model Building**: Develop, compare, and fine-tune machine learning models.

## **Lessons Learned**
1. **Project Ideation**:
* Have it clear what's the variable you want to predict since the start
* Check if you have enough data available to create a trustable prediction
* You'll probably find more data to clean during data analysis
* You'll probably do some feature engineering during data analysis
2. **Use of ChatGPT**:
* Check and correct queries
* Add comments on what's being done
* Improve queries performance
* Factorize queries into functions
* Create checks for errors
* Create or improve charts
