# **Data Science Crossfit Project**
This project aims to explore trends, identify top performers, and gain a deeper understanding of the CrossFit Games and the participating athletes by collecting, cleaning, and analyzing the data and creating a model.

## **Project Steps**
1. **Data Collection**: Scrape data from the official CrossFit Games website.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Filter irrelevant columns, handle missing values, etc.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Analyze variables statistically to gain insights.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Create new columns with relevant data to enhance the model.
5. **Model Building**: Develop, compare, and fine-tune machine learning models.
6. **Model Productionization**: Deploy the model for production use.

## **Lessons Learned**
1. **Project Ideation**:
* Have it clear what's the variable you want to predict since the start
* Check if you have enough data available to create a trustable prediction
2. **Use of ChatGPT**:
* Checking and correcting queries
* Adding comments on what's being done
* Improving queries performance
* Factorizing queries into functions
